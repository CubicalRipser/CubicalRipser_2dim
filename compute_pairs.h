CubicalRipser: C++ system for computation of Cubical persistence pairs

CubicalRipser is deeply depending on 'Ripser', software for Vietoris-Rips 
persitence pairs by Ulrich Bauer, 2015-2016.  We appreciate Ulrich very much.
We rearrange his codes of Ripser and add some new ideas for optimization on it 
and modify it for calculation of a Cubical filtration.

This part of CubicalRiper is a calculator of cubical persistence pairs for 
2 dimensional pixel data. The input data format conforms to that of DIPHA.
